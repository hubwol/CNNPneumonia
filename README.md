# Chest X-ray Pneumonia Classification using CNN
## Overview
This project was completed as part of the team project for the Applied Models of Data Analysis course. It explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classifying chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia. The goal is to build a model that can automatically classify X-ray images as either normal or affected by pneumonia, aiding in faster and more accurate diagnoses. The CNN was developed using PyTorch to leverage its flexibility and efficiency in deep learning model development.
